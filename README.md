## Warning

**This fork was made specifically to work with Ubuntu or Pop OS 22.04 aka Jammy!**

If you are going to set an image file that has spaces in its file name or folders, remember to
scape them with backslashes.

## Installation

First, you will need to install libglib2.0-dev-bin with `sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev-bin`
Then, you can download the script with the command below:
```
wget wget github.com/Chillsmeit/change-gdm-background/raw/master/change-gdm-background-jammy
```
And set it as an executable with `chmod +x change-gdm-background-jammy`

## Usage

Run the script with root privileges such as `sudo ./change-gdm-background-jammy /path/to/image`.

If you see a message `login image sucessfully changed`, then, when you restart gdm or reboot your
computer, your gdm background should be covered with the image you selected.

You can restore your original gdm theme any time with `sudo ./change-gdm-background-jammy
--restore`.

### Change Color

Now you can change that annoying purple color to any color you like. Just type `sudo
./change-gdm-background-jammy \#yourhexcode` and voil√°, you changed it. Your color hex format should
be of six characters like \\#407294 or three characters like \\#6ac.

### Multi-screen support

if you use two or more monitors you may see a streched image through the displays as if they were
    one screen. This is the default behavior of GDM3 when dealing with multiple displays.

I found a way to configure GDM to work in other modes like mirror or even single display
[here](https://github.com/thiggy01/change-gdm-background/issues/15), avoiding the joining of them.
